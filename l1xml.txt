=>XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
eXtensible = Exten our notation
Markup = Write using Markup
Language = Create your own document

XML is not all the same HTML. But both are Markup Language.
XML is used to describe the data. HTML is used to display the data.
XML must define custom rules(tags). HTML has pre-define rules(tags)

HTML document = Display Data ( HTML designed to display data and focus on how data look )
